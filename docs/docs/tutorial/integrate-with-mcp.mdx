# Integrate with MCP

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol developed by Anthropic
to standardize how language models interact with external systems—such as tools,
memory backends, and context managers. MCP enables structured, dynamic
communication between an LLM and its environment, empowering models to access
external tools, retrieve real-time information, and perform complex, multi-step
reasoning.

### Using MCP with Ailoy

Ailoy Agents can seamlessly integrate with existing MCP-compliant servers. For
example, the following code connects to the official GitHub MCP server:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

agent.add_tools_from_mcp_server(
    StdioServerParameters(
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    )
)
```

```typescript
await agent.addToolsFromMcpServer({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
});
```

</CodeTabs>

This launches the GitHub MCP server as a subprocess using standard I/O for
communication. The agent automatically discovers the tools exposed by the server
and registers them into its internal toolset.

### Querying via MCP Tools

Once the tools are registered, the agent can invoke them as needed when you 
call the query() method:

<CodeTabs>

```python
question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
for resp in agent.query(question):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
const question =
  "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

</CodeTabs>

This demonstrates how the agent utilizes the GitHub MCP tools to search
repositories and summarize their contents.

### Complete Example

Here is the full source code to set up an agent, connect it to the GitHub MCP
server, and issue a query:

<CodeTabs>

```python
from ailoy import Runtime, Agent
from mcp import StdioServerParameters

rt = Runtime()
with Agent(rt, model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-8B") as agent:
    # Add tools from Github MCP server
    agent.add_tools_from_mcp_server(
        StdioServerParameters(
            command="npx",
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
        )
    )

    question = "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md."
    for resp in agent.query(question):
        agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
import { startRuntime, defineAgent } from "ailoy-node";

(async () => {
  const rt = await startRuntime();
  const agent = await defineAgent(rt, { model: { name: "Qwen/Qwen3-8B" } });

  // Add tools from Github MCP server
  await agent.addToolsFromMcpServer({
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  });

  const question =
    "Search the repository named brekkylab/ailoy and describe what it does based on its README.md.";
  for await (const resp of agent.query(question)) {
    agent.print(resp);
  }
})();
```
