# Reasoning

Reasoning is an advanced capability of AI that enables it to tackle complex
tasks through explicit, step-by-step logical inference. Reasoning models break
down problems into smaller sub-tasks rather than solving them in a single pass.
Compared to direct answer generation, it offers two key advantages:

1. Improved problem-solving intelligence
2. Transparent and traceable intermediate reasoning steps

This functionality is particularly well-suited for domains that require
multi-step reasoning, such as scientific analysis, legal interpretation, or
strategic decision-making. However, since the reasoning step needs additional
computation and memory usage, it can increase latency and overall resource
consumption. Therefore, it’s important to enable reasoning only when necessary,
based on the complexity of your use case.

Reasoning may not be supported on some models. The `Qwen3` model currently available in Ailoy supports reasoning.

## How to enable reasoning

In Ailoy, You can activate reasoning feature by simply specifying an option `enable_reasoning`.

<CodeTabs>

```python
for resp in agent.query(
    "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
    enable_reasoning=True
):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
for await (const resp of agent.query(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  {
    enableReasoning: true,
  }
)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

### Dismiss reasoning messages

Since reasoning is an internal process, you might want to ignore it in the output.
In such cases, you can use the `ignore_reasoning_messages` option to make `Agent` to dismiss the reasoning tokens.

<CodeTabs>

```python
for resp in agent.query(
    "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
    enable_reasoning=True,
    ignore_reasoning_messages=True
):
    agent.print(resp)
```

```typescript
for await (const resp of agent.query(
  "Please solve me a simultaneous equation: x+y=3, 4x+3y=12",
  {
    enableReasoning: true,
    ignoreReasoningMessages: true,
  }
)) {
  agent.print(resp);
}
```

:::note 
Note: Qwen3-0.6b is too small to perform effective reasoning.
We recommend using a model with bigger parameters for reasoning tasks.
