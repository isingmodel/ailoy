In Ailoy, a **tool** allows an agent to access functionality beyond what the base language model can offer, such as real-time data or domain-specific APIs.

Each tool is defined using two components:

### Description

The `description` field defines how the AI understands and uses the tool. It follows the standard described in **[tool definitions of Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.51.3/en/chat_templating_writing#tool-definitions)**, including details such as the tool's name, purpose, input parameters, and example usage. This helps the LLM decide *when* and *how* to use the tool.

### Behavior

The `behavior` field defines how the tool actually behaves when invoked. This varies depending on the tool type. For example, a REST API tool includes the endpoint URL, HTTP method, and headers. A native tool may define a Python or Node.js function, while a built-in tool delegates the behavior to a pre-defined module.

To see the examples, take a look at the **[Out-of-the-box tools](#out-of-the-box-tools)** section.

## Types

There are three types of tools in Ailoy. While they all share a common `description` format, each type defines `behavior` differently.

### REST API tools

REST API tools allow the AI to access external APIs over HTTP. This is ideal for retrieving real-time or third-party information.

#### Behavior
REST API tools basically send requests to get their results.

The `behavior` object of a REST API tool definition can contain:

- URL(`baseURL`), HTTP method(`method`) and headers(`headers`) to define the REST API request to send.

- Authentication method(`authentication`) to apply pre-defined authentication injection.
If the API does not require authentication or needs custom one, the authentication field might not be contained.

- Body content(`body`) to be the requests body of `POST` or `PUT` requests.

- A JMESPath query string(`outputPath`) to process the raw results of the REST API into useful data.

The parameters that the LLM decided to put into the REST API tool can become:

- Path parameters: Ones included as `{param_name}` in the `baseUrl` field
- Body parameters: Ones included as `{param_name}` in the `body` field
- Query parameters: Ones other than path parameters or body parameters

***Tool definition*** for a REST API tool finally looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "restapi",
  "description": {...},
  "behavior": {
    "baseURL": "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${movie_id}/recommendations",
    "method": "GET",
    "authentication": "bearer",
    "headers": {
      "accept": "application/json"
    },
    "outputPath": "results[:5].{id: id, title: title, overview: overview, original_language: original_language, genre_ids: genre_ids, release_date: release_date, vote_average: vote_average, adult:adult}"
  }
}
```

#### How to add your own tools

You can make your `Agent` call any REST API you want by adding a REST API tool through:

- `agent.add_restapi_tool()` (for ***Python***)
- `agent.addRESTAPITool()` (for ***Node.js***).

These functions get a ***tool definition***, and an ***authenticator*** optionally as their parameters.  
- **Tool definition**: Object including type, description, and behavior of the tool
- **Authenticator**(*optional*): Callable object that injects authentication to the REST API calls

<CodeTabs>

```python
with Agent(...) as agent:
    bearer_api_key = ...;

    agent.add_restapi_tool(
        tool_def={...},      # Tool definition
        authenticator=BearerAuthenticator(bearer_api_key),
    )
```

```typescript
const agent = await defineAgent(...);

const bearerApiKey = ...;

agent.addRESTAPITool(
  {...},      // Tool definition
  { authenticator: bearerAutenticator(bearerApiKey) }
);
```
</CodeTabs>

### Built-in tools

Built-in tools uses the function of Ailoyâ€™s internal module system. It work across all the environments supported. These tools are pre-registered and can be referenced by name.

#### Behavior

Defined by preset behavior implemented inside Ailoy. The only thing defined outside of Ailoy is the JMESPath query string(`outputPath`) to process the raw results of the function into useful data.

***Tool definition*** for a built-in tool looks like:

```json
{
  "type": "built-in",
  "description": {...},
  "behavior": {
    "outputPath": "value"
  }
}
```

> *Built-in tools are not designed to be added at runtime.*

### Native tools

Native tools allow developers to define custom Python functions that will be executed when the AI requests a tool call. This is useful for logic that lives inside your application.

#### Behavior

A Python or Node.js function or coroutine that will be called with arguments from the AI.

#### How to add your own tools

You can write your own tool as a native function and add it to the `Agent` through:
- `agent.add_py_function_tool()` (for ***Python***)
- `agent.addJsFunctionTool()` (for ***Node.js***).

These functions get a ***custom native function*** and its ***tool description*** as their parameters.  

<CodeTabs>

```python
def a_useful_function_impl(arg0, arg1):
    a_useful_value = 0
    ...              # Your own codes
    return a_useful_value

with Agent(...) as agent:
    agent.add_py_function_tool(
        f=a_useful_function_impl,
        desc={...},      # Tool description
    )
```

```typescript
const a_useful_function_impl = ({ arg0, arg1 }) => {
    let a_useful_value = 0
    ...       // Your own codes
    return a_useful_value
  };

const agent = await defineAgent(...);
agent.addJSFunctionTool(
  {...},      // Tool description
  a_useful_function_impl
);
```

## Out-of-the-box tools

These are the **[preset tools](https://github.com/brekkylab/ailoy/tree/main/presets/tools)** in Ailoy that you can use.

### Calculator
A calculator that evaluates a mathatical expression as a floating-point number.

The expression string can include floating-point numbers, arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`), parentheses, and the mathematical constants and functions listed below.

For example,
- `"sqrt(3^2 + 4^2)"` evaluates to `5.0`
- `"6/2*(1+2)"` evaluates to `9.0`
- `"sin(pi/2)"` evaluates to `1.0`.

#### Mathematical Constants and Functions
Behaviors of these are same as ones in **[cmath](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath)**.


| Symbols | Descriptions |
|---|---|
| `e`, `pi` | Mathematical constants |
| `abs(x)`, `round(x)`, `trunc(x)`, `floor(x)`, `ceil(x)` | Common value adjustment functions |
| `sqrt(x)`, `cbrt(x)` | Root of the value functions |
| `ln(x)`, `log(x)`, `log10(x)` | Logarithms |
| `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)` | Trigonometric functions |
| `asin(x)`, `acos(x)`, `atan(x)`, `atan2(y,x)` | Inverse trigonometric functions |
| `sinh(x)`, `cosh(x)`, `tanh(x)` | Hyperbolic functions |
| `fac(n)`, `ncr(n,r)`, `npr(n,r)` | Combinatorial functions |

#### Code to apply this tool
<CodeTabs>

```python
with Agent(...) as agent:
    agent.add_tools_from_preset("calculator")
    agent.query("Evaluate sin(pi/2).")
```

```typescript
const agent = await defineAgent(...);
agent.addToolsFromPreset("calculator");
agent.query("Evaluate sin(pi/2).")
```
</CodeTabs>


#### Example message to use this tool
`Evaluate sin(pi/2).`  
`I want to know the value of sqrt(3^2 + 4^2).`  
`Calculate "6/2*(1+2)"`

### Frankfurter (Currency exchange rates)
A public API provided by the European Central Bank that provides currency exchange rate information.

```

```typescript
const agent = await defineAgent(...);
agent.addToolsFromPreset("frankfurter");
agent.query("I want to buy 100 U.S. Dollar with my Korean Won. How much do I need to take?")
```
</CodeTabs>

#### Example message to use this tool

#### API key
You can get a New York Times API key here: **[link](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started)**

When you add tool to your agent, the API key can be provided.
NY Times API requires to put API key in the query parameter, so you can add it to the query parameter as below.

This is an example of applying authentication in the way you want.
